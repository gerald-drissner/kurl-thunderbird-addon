## The Name `kurl`

The name **kurl** is a playful fusion of two words: **"k"** from the German word **"kurz,"** which means **short**, and **"url"**. In German, a short URL is often referred to as a **"Kurz-URL,"** making **kurl** a fitting and concise name for a URL shortener.

## About YOURLS (Your Own URL Shortener)

YOURLS is a free, open-source set of PHP scripts that allows you to run your own URL shortening service. Unlike commercial services like bit.ly, YOURLS gives you full control over your data, with powerful features like detailed statistics, link management, and a plugin architecture to extend its functionality.

This Thunderbird add-on requires you to have your own YOURLS instance already installed and running on a web server.

### How to Install YOURLS

Self-hosting YOURLS requires a web server with PHP and a MySQL database. The general steps are:

1.  Download the latest version of YOURLS from their official website.
2.  Unzip the files and upload them to your web server.
3.  Create a MySQL database and a user for it.
4.  Configure the `config.php` file with your database details, site URL, and a secure signature token.
5.  Run the installation script by navigating to `http://your-domain.com/admin/` in your browser.

For complete and detailed instructions, please refer to the official guide:
**[Official YOURLS Installation Guide](https://yourls.org/#Install)**

### Finding Your API Signature Token

To connect this add-on to your YOURLS instance, you need your unique API signature token.

1.  Log in to your YOURLS admin dashboard (e.g., `http://your-domain.com/admin/`).
2.  In the top menu, click on **Tools**.
3.  At the very top of the Tools page, you will find a section titled **"Secure passwordless API call"**. Your API signature token is the long string of characters displayed there.

## Installation of this Add-on

There are two ways to install **kurl**:

### üîπ Option 1: Install from Thunderbird Add-ons

You can install the latest version (**v1.6**) directly from the official Thunderbird Add-ons repository:

Click **‚ÄúAdd to Thunderbird‚Äù** and follow the prompts.

### üîπ Option 2: Manual Installation

## Usage

Before first use, you must configure the add-on by going to `Add-ons and Themes`, finding "kurl", and opening its preferences. You will need to enter your YOURLS instance URL and your API signature token.

### In the Compose Window

When writing an email, you have three ways to shorten a URL:

1.  **Toolbar Button:** Click the "kurl" icon in the compose window's toolbar to open the popup.
2.  **Context Menu:** Select a long URL in the editor, right-click, and choose **`kurl: Shorten selection‚Ä¶`**.
3.  **Keyboard Shortcut:** Select a URL and press the keyboard shortcut to open the popup with the URL pre-filled.
      * The default shortcut is **`Ctrl+Shift+K`**.

### When Reading an Email

You can also shorten URLs found in emails you've received.

1.  **In a Separate Window/Tab** (after double-clicking an email):

      * **Right-Click Menu:** Select a URL or link, right-click, and choose **`kurl: Shorten selection‚Ä¶`**. The popup will open with the URL pre-filled.

2.  **In the Main 3-Pane View:**

      * **Right-Click Menu (Prime & Click):** To avoid interrupting your workflow, the right-click menu here works differently. Select a URL, right-click, and choose **`kurl: Copy URL to prime (no popup)`**. This copies the URL into the add-on without opening a window. A small notification will appear. Then, click the **kurl icon** in the message header to open the popup with your URL ready to be shortened.

3.  **Keyboard Shortcut:** While viewing a message, you can use **`Ctrl+Alt+K`**. This opens the popup and pre-fills it with any URL you have selected in the message body.

You can change the default shortcuts in Thunderbird by going to `Tools > Add-ons and Themes`, clicking the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to "kurl", and selecting "Manage Extension Shortcuts".
